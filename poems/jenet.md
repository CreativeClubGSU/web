Daily,
Monsters prowl our streets,  
Heaven on their lips, hell in their souls
Inciting terror in our hearts yet, 
Wearing the cassocks of peace.
Abductions and molestation lining their path
Intertwined with guns, hate speeches and blood
Careless posts on social media
Pushing us from pan to fire,
Deafening cries of men and women 
Screaming for help.

Instead,
Our eyes dwell on the North and South fighting
And the once tranquil west now joining in the
Pandemonium, wreaking havoc
In a country where nobody is safe.
Unable to tell our stories
Yet able to shine the spotlight on those 
Erroneously labelled 'outsiders'

'They don't like us either'
'They killed my brother in their village 
So I will kill their kinsman in my state!'
'They started it!'
'They deserved it!'

And so the blood feud continues,
Fuelled by deceit shrouded in truth.
The fiery shackles of fake news and half-truths
Holding our people captives,
Circulating filthy lies signed in God's holy name,
Inciting more violence while pretending to solve the problem.

Do you not know,
No nation can rise by burying its weak and poor,
No country can grow by ignoring the plight of its people  
Labelled minorities and refugees in their own country.
Indeed,
A cancer in one cell will engulf the whole system if left unchecked. 

Who can challenge the cycle of woes strangling our country?
Who dares to open her lips and sing of serenity?
Who is he that'll take the courage to break these chains,
And lead Nigeria to a new life of justice, integrity and transparency;
Where every citizen gets a taste of what independence truly means? 

Tune in to this channel and let me tell you a story:
A new tide is rising, powerful and determined
Tongues sharpened by pain and language,
Drunk with the elixir in which creativity and activism meet.

This is the voice of the new Nigeria,
Rising from within the bellows of its creatives.
Every note and melody, every line and stanza,
Every splash of colour from the painter's brush, 
Every script, every headline, every stroke of the sculptor's knife;
Joining their voices to challenge the single stories
That have marred the beauty in our diversity.
Giving a voice to the humanity 
Stubbornly fighting inspite of the odds.

Like a stone thrown into a pond,
Ripples of patriotism are echoed from Chibok to Owo, 
Dapchi to Nnewi and Daura and Warri;
Young and old ignited by fresh perspectives,
Refusing to remain silent,
Breaking free with chants of liberty, liberty for all!
Re-learning national identity, 
Questioning every rumour,
Analysing every evidence,
Investigating every tale,
Crushing the rock of propaganda 
With the hammer of right information
Streaming from our creatives -
Innovative, brilliant stars, 
Leading us all to a nation we can truly be proud of. 

Thank you.

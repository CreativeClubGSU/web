# A Son, A Bandit, and A Victim 

Born at sunset, 
I am a child weaned from fallen breast before time. 
Son of a fertile ground 
But fed with thorns and thistles. 

I can only watch the spoilers – 
They glut and yawn and leak their oily fingers. 
A seed, but I am taken to the mill; 
Flour for bread, a means to an end. 

I am the child with the guns, 
A pawn on this chessboard of terror. 
A thorn in the flesh of many: 
I am horror – a harvest of many errors. 

The spoilers ate sour grapes 
And my teeth is at edge. 
Brought to sunset before dawn, 
I am a child, a bandit, and a victim.

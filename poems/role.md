# The role of creative voices

I see them building on acres,
we haven't got the power,
but our hands got the blessings,
which are important in the countries.

But listen to  my words which are infinite,
when it comes to a circle,
to write on the advantage,
not only advantage,
but also diversity,
in terms of helping society,
In the presence, past, and future.

It's about the gallants,
that have powers,
to change the mind of society,
in terms of  language grammar,
since the year of a junior,
section of students,
and this help to understand the language,
which is the lead of all subjects,
one of the subjects include physics,
which help the engineers to 
understand their category,
and even build a sky crapers,
that society organisms,
live on it without knowing,
it's the power of voices that
 dedicated their pen ink,
which became crucial to the society.
